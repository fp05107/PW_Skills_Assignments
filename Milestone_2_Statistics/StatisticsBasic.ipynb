    "## 1. What is statistics, and why is it important?\n",
    "Statistics is the science of collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It's important because:\n",
    "- Helps make informed decisions based on data\n",
    "- Enables prediction of future trends\n",
    "- Provides tools for testing hypotheses\n",
    "- Essential for scientific research and business analytics\n",
    "- Helps understand uncertainty and variability in data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. What are the two main types of statistics?\n",
    "The two main types are:\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizes and describes data\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics**: Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on sample data\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. What are descriptive statistics?\n",
    "Descriptive statistics are methods used to summarize and describe the main features of a dataset. Examples include:\n",
    "- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)\n",
    "- Measures of variability (range, variance, standard deviation)\n",
    "- Graphical representations (histograms, box plots)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. What is inferential statistics?\n",
    "Inferential statistics uses sample data to make generalizations about a larger population. It includes:\n",
    "- Hypothesis testing\n",
    "- Confidence intervals\n",
    "- Regression analysis\n",
    "- ANOVA\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. What is sampling in statistics?\n",
    "Sampling is the process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population to estimate characteristics of the whole population. It's done because studying the entire population is often impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. What are the different types of sampling methods?\n",
    "Main sampling methods:\n",
    "- **Probability Sampling**:\n",

    "**Random Sampling**:\n",
    "- Every member has known, non-zero chance of selection\n",
    "- Reduces bias\n",
    "- Allows for statistical inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Non-Random Sampling**:\n",
    "- Selection based on convenience or judgment\n",
    "- May introduce bias\n",
    "- Limits generalizability\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. Define and give examples of qualitative and quantitative data\n",
    "**Qualitative Data** (Categorical):\n",
    "- Describes qualities/characteristics\n",
    "- Examples: Gender, color, satisfaction level\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative Data** (Numerical):\n",
    "- Can be measured numerically\n",
    "- Examples: Height, weight, temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. What are the different types of data in statistics?\n",
    "Four measurement scales:\n",
    "1. **Nominal**: Categories without order (e.g., colors)\n",
    "2. **Ordinal**: Ordered categories (e.g., satisfaction levels)\n",
    "3. **Interval**: Equal intervals, no true zero (e.g., temperature in °C)\n",
    "4. **Ratio**: Equal intervals with true zero (e.g., height, weight)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. Explain nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio levels of measurement\n",
    "- **Nominal**: Categories without mathematical meaning (e.g., gender, race)\n",
    "- **Ordinal**: Ordered categories where difference between values isn't meaningful (e.g., Likert scales)\n",
    "- **Interval**: Equal intervals between values, no true zero (e.g., temperature in Celsius)\n",
    "- **Ratio**: Equal intervals with true zero point (e.g., height, weight, age)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. What is the measure of central tendency?\n",
    "Measures of central tendency describe the center or typical value of a dataset. The three main measures are:\n",
    "- Mean\n",
    "- Median\n",
    "- Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "## 12. Define mean, median, and mode\n",
    "- **Mean**: The average (sum of all values divided by number of values)\n",
    "- **Median**: The middle value when data is ordered\n",
    "- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value\n",
    "\n",
    "## 13. What is the significance of the measure of central tendency?\n",
    "Significance:\n",
    "- Provides a single value representing the entire dataset\n",
    "- Helps compare different datasets\n",
    "- Serves as basis for many statistical analyses\n",
    "- Gives first impression of data distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "## 14. What is variance, and how is it calculated?\n",
    "Variance measures how far each number in a dataset is from the mean. Calculation:\n",
    "1. Find the mean\n",
    "2. Subtract mean from each data point and square the result\n",
    "3. Average these squared differences\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula: σ² = Σ(xᵢ - μ)²/N\n",
    "\n",
    "## 15. What is standard deviation, and why is it important?\n",
    "Standard deviation is the square root of variance. It's important because:\n",
    "- Measures dispersion in same units as original data\n",
    "- Indicates how spread out data is\n",
    "- Helps identify outliers\n",
    "- Fundamental for many statistical tests\n",
    "\n",
    "## 16. Define and explain the term range in statistics\n",
    "Range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a dataset. It's the simplest measure of dispersion but sensitive to outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 17. What is the difference between variance and standard deviation?\n",
    "- **Variance**: Average of squared deviations from mean (units squared)\n",
    "- **Standard Deviation**: Square root of variance (original units)\n",
    "- SD is more interpretable as it's in same units as data\n",

    "- **Negatively skewed**: Mean < Median, tail extends to left\n",
    "\n",
    "## 20. Define and explain kurtosis\n",
    "Kurtosis measures the \"tailedness\" of a distribution:\n",
    "- **Leptokurtic**: Heavy tails, peaked (kurtosis > 3)\n",
    "- **Mesokurtic**: Normal tails (kurtosis = 3)\n",
    "- **Platykurtic**: Light tails, flat (kurtosis < 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 21. What is the purpose of covariance?\n",
    "Covariance measures how two variables change together:\n",
    "- Indicates direction of linear relationship\n",

    "- +1: Perfect positive correlation\n",
    "- -1: Perfect negative correlation\n",
    "- 0: No linear correlation\n",
    "\n",
    "## 23. What is the difference between covariance and correlation?\n",
    "- **Covariance**: Measures direction of relationship (unstandardized)\n",
    "- **Correlation**: Measures strength and direction (standardized to -1 to 1)\n",
    "- Correlation is dimensionless, covariance units are product of variable units\n",
