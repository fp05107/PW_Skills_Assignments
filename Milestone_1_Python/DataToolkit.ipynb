    "## 21. Why is NumPy‚Äôs array slicing faster than Python‚Äôs list slicing?\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy‚Äôs array slicing is faster than Python‚Äôs list slicing due to several key reasons related to the underlying data structures and implementation:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Homogeneous Data Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NumPy arrays** store elements of the **same data type** in a contiguous block of memory (like a C array).\n",
    "* **Python lists** can store elements of different types, so they store references (pointers) to Python objects scattered in memory.\n",
    "* Accessing contiguous memory in NumPy is faster because CPU caching is more effective.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Views Instead of Copies**\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy slicing typically returns a **view** of the original array, not a copy.\n",
    "* This means no new memory allocation or data copying occurs during slicing ‚Äî it just creates a new way to access the existing data.\n",
    "* Python list slicing **creates a new list (copy)**, which involves allocating new memory and copying elements, making it slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Optimized Low-level Implementation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* NumPy operations are implemented in **C and Fortran**, enabling highly optimized and compiled code execution.\n",
    "* Python lists slicing is implemented at the Python interpreter level, which is slower due to dynamic typing and interpreter overhead.\n",
